    <h1>Arapahoe Basin</h1>
    <h4>
      Since 1946, Arapahoe Basin has been serving up a fantastic ride for skiers and riders from Colorado and all over the world. We're often the first in Colorado to open - if not the nation - and the last in Colorado to close. Arapahoe Basin receives over 350 inches of snowfall annually.
